You need to be in a synchronized block in order for Object.wait() to work.
Also, I recommend looking at the concurrency packages instead of the old school threading packages. They are safer and way easier to work with.

 Selenium server command options while starting server.
Post by Adviser on Wed Sep 09, 2009 9:33 am

Usage: java -jar selenium-server.jar [-interactive] [options]

-port : the port number the selenium server should use
(default 4444)

-timeout : an integer number of seconds before we should give
up

-interactive: puts you into interactive mode. See the tutorial for
more details

-multiWindow: puts you into a mode where the test web site executes
in a separate window, and selenium supports frames

-forcedBrowserMode : sets the browser mode (e.g.
"*iexplore" for all sessions, no matter what is passed to
getNewBrowserSession

-userExtensions : indicates a JavaScript file that will be
loaded into selenium

-browserSessionReuse: stops re-initialization and spawning of the
browser between tests

-avoidProxy: By default, we proxy every browser request; set this
flag to make the browser use our proxy only for URLs containing
'/selenium-server'

-firefoxProfileTemplate : normally, we generate a fresh empty
Firefox profile every time we launch. You can specify a directory
to make us copy your profile directory instead.
-debug: puts you into debug mode, with more trace information and
diagnostics on the console

-browserSideLog: enables logging on the browser side; logging
messages will be transmitted to the server. This can affect
performance.

-ensureCleanSession: If the browser does not have user profiles,
make sure every new session has no artifacts from previous
sessions. For example, enabling this option will cause all user
cookies to be archived before launching IE, and restored after IE
is closed.

-trustAllSSLCertificates: Forces the Selenium proxy to trust all
SSL certificates. This doesn't work in browsers that don't use the
Selenium proxy.

-log : writes lots of debug information out to a log
file

-htmlSuite : Run a
single HTML Selenese (Selenium Core) suite and then exit
immediately, using the specified browser (e.g. "*firefox") on the
specified URL (e.g. "http://www.google.com"). You need to specify
the absolute path to the HTML test suite as well as the path to the
HTML results file we'll generate.
-proxyInjectionMode: puts you into proxy injection mode, a mode
where the selenium server acts as a proxy server for all content
going to the test application. Under this mode, multiple domains
can be visited, and the following additional flags are supported:

-dontInjectRegex : an optional regular expression that
proxy injection mode can use to know when to bypss injection

-userJsInjection : specifies a JavaScript file which will
then be injected into all pages

-userContentTransformation : a regular
expression which is matched against all test HTML content; the
second is a string which will replace matches. These flags can
be used any number of times. A simple example of how this could
be useful: if you add "-userContentTransformation https http"
then all "https" strings in the HTML of the test application will
be changed to be "http".

seleniumhq plugin
http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/seleniumhq/latest/
 download it and install this plugin in jenkins
here we cannot use this plugin for our testing ,as we using the testNG framework for testing.

share value in different class file ,we can use the static keyword to share the variable in the different class file

All Test tools have a way to handle unexpected events like a popup alert or a page not
 found error. Like for example in QTP there is something called the recovery scenario manager. 
 Here one could define a bunch of scenarios, one for each unexpected event and the recovery action to be 
 taken if and when such an event presents itself. This would be something like if there is an pop-up alert
  with text "Session expired. Do you want to re-login?" then Click OK on the dialog box (this takes you to 
  login page) and Login again.

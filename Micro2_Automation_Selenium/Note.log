I just had this problem and I'm pretty confident that it's a bug in the TestNG Plugin for eclipse, since I was able to run my tests from the command line just fine.

The fix that seems to be working for me and others is just to clean your project (Project â†’ Clean). One person had to re-install the whole plugin.
